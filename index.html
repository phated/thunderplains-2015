To some it might appear that our language—which already seems accessible and approachable for beginners— is becoming even more accessible and approachable. However, both the humanities and CS education research have proven that abstraction, while a powerful tool for knowledgeable practitioners, can be an equally powerful foil for beginners. As we enter the era of language-level abstractions in ES6/2015, we are charged with the task of rethinking how we teach JavaScript. Through an interdisciplinary montage I will identify the problem of teaching abstraction as a ubiquitous demand across nearly every domain, and align the issues of creativity and critical thinking in the humanities with issues in computer science. The talk will conclude with a discussion of how the discipline of computer science and that of the humanities can inform each other to produce more effective and creative solutions to both developing and teaching abstractions.</p></div><div id="williams-bio" class="tab-pane"><p>Formerly a NYC Teaching Fellow, Ashley learned the ropes teaching middle school science in Harlem, NYC.

WebGL is a fairly low-level API that has a lot of power and archane complexity. Most of the knowledge-base for GL-related technologies is written towards developers of non-web technologies. I would like to boil this technology down into a simple conceptual intro of the lower-level API that is specifically targeted towards web developers. I would also like to challenge the attendees on what future applications can be built using WebGL and how it will fundamentally change how we interact with the web.</p></div><div id="tatum-bio" class="tab-pane"><p>With a background in contemporary sculpture, aquarium exhibit design, marketing, animation, and web development, Greg is all over the place.

To give you some idea, just 5 pages of "Javascript basics" attached to my Japanese jQuery book was more helpful than any English tutorials.

What about the best APIs? Having been part of the gulp 4 and lodash 3 development efforts, I've found that taking time to think through your APIs before beginning development leads to better APIs and more concise code. In this talk, I plan to show the payoff to thinking through APIs before writing any code behind them with comparison to libraries that often release API breaking changes, which can cause users to have painful upgrade processes.</p></div><div id="bubblitz-bio" class="tab-pane"><p>Co-Founder of @IcedDev  <br/>Co-founder of hackPHX (http://hackphx.com ) <br/> Project lead of @FrozenJS (http://frozenjs.com )</p></div></div></div></div><div class="schedule-time"><time>4:30pm-5:20pm</time></div><div class="schedule-keynote"><p>Closing Keynote</p><div class="schedule-talk"><div class="schedule-talk"><div class="schedule-title"><img src="speakers/kyle-simpson/headshot.png" alt="Kyle Simpson"/><h3>Breaking The Broken Web</h3><h4>Kyle Simpson</h4></div><ul role="tablist" class="nav nav-tabs"><li class="nav-room1 active"><a role="tab" data-toggle="tab" href="#Simpson-talk">Talk</a></li><li class="nav-room1"><a role="tab" data-toggle="tab" href="#Simpson-bio">Bio</a></li></ul><div class="tab-content"><div id="Simpson-talk" class="tab-pane active"><p>The web is fundamentally broken in two deeply profound ways, and unfortunately the only way we're going to move forward is to painfully break from our past and present realities.<br/>First, we have to break our notion of backwards compatibility and free ourselves from past technical baggage. Then we have to break how we're building the web currently to revisit the honored principles of progressive enhancement and responsive design, but take them much further. To truly include and empower every single person on the planet in the global audience of the web we're building, from a tribe member in an African village to a poor migrant worker in a border town, we need a web that is vastly more layered and nuanced and adaptive.<br/>And most of all, we need to stop deceiving ourselves that device capabilities are the key factors driving the user's experience. Ultimately, user choice must be paramount.</p></div><div id="Simpson-bio" class="tab-pane"><p>Kyle Simpson is an Open Web Evangelist from Austin, TX, who's passionate about all things JavaScript.<br/>He's an author, workshop trainer, tech speaker, and OSS contributor/leader.</p></div></div></div></div></div><div class="schedule-time"><time>5:30pm-6:00pm</time></div><div class="schedule-event"><p>Closing Remarks &amp; Prize Drawing</p></div><div class="schedule-time"><time>6:30pm - ?</time></div><div class="schedule-event"><p>After Party (Off-site)</p></div></div></section><section id="coc"><h2 class="section-title">Code of Conduct</h2><p class="container">Before attending the conference,<a href="https://github.com/techlahoma/CodeofConduct/wiki/Techlahoma-Code-of-Conduct">please review the Thunder Plains Code of Conduct</a>.
